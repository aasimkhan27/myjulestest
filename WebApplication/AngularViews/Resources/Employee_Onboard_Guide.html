             <p>New employee onboarding is the process of integrating a new employee with a company and its culture, as well as getting a new hire the tools and information needed to become a productive member of the team.</p>
             <p>Onboarding new hires at an organization should be a strategic process that lasts at least one year, staffing and HR experts say, because how employers handle the first few days and months of a new employee’s experience is crucial to ensuring high retention.</p>

            <p>Finding the best candidates for positions in your organization is only part of building an effective team. The process of onboarding new employees can be one of the most critical factors in ensuring recently hired talent will be productive, contented workers. </p>
            <p>However, in some organizations, onboarding is often confused with orientation. While orientation might be necessary—paperwork and other routine tasks must be completed—onboarding is a comprehensive process involving management and other employees that can last up to 12 months.</p>
            <p>Before implementing a formal onboarding program, employers should answer some key questions to attain team and upper management buy-in, including:</p>
            <ul class="text-indent">
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> When will onboarding start?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> How long will it last?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> What impression do you want new hires to walk away with at the end of the first day?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> What do new employees need to know about the culture and work environment?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> What role will HR play in the process? What about direct managers? Co-workers?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> What kind of goals do you want to set for new employees?</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm text-blue mr-2"></i> How will you gather feedback on the program and measure its success?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once these questions have been answered, HR professionals and upper management can devise a plan of action to help new employees quickly assimilate company policies and workflow while getting fully acquainted with the organization’s culture.</p>
