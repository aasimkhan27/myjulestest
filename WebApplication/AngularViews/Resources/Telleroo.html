            <p>
                When a pay run is created, learn what the statuses mean and what you need to do next. All pay runs in Telleroo follow the same 5 statuses. These statuses let you know what actions need to happen next. We recommend watching the video below as these are the bases of Telleroo.
            </p>
            <p><span class="text-bold">Awaiting approval</span> – The pay run has been created and is awaiting approval. This action does not require you to have any balance.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bold">Scheduled</span> – The pay run has been approved but the date you want the payments to be released has not to be reached. This action does not require you to have any balance.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bold">Awaiting funds</span> – The pay run has been approved and the scheduled date reached. The balance on your account means that some or all of the payments couldn’t be sent. These payments are now in a queued state and will send once funds are added to Telleroo.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bold">Sending</span> – The pay run is sending. As our payments are all sent on the faster payment system they generally move to paid within 10-20 seconds.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bold">Paid</span> – The pay run has now been successfully sent and the payees will now have the funds in their bank account.</p>

            <p>Funding your Telleroo account, to send scheduled and awaiting funds pay runs. If your accountant doesn’t have access to send funds from your bank account, you will need to add funds to your Telleroo account.</p>

            <p class="text-bold">How to add funds to your account?</p>
            <p>In your accounts panel, you have your own account number and sort code. This is unique to your company. We can only receive funds from a bank account matching the Telleroo account name.</p>
            <p class="text-bold">Maximum top-up amount?</p>
            <p>The maximum you can send into Telleroo in one go is £300K. To add more just send another separate transfer.</p>
