                <li>Make sure there is only one manager in the safe during each shift. This will probably be the manager in charge or manager on duty.</li>
                <li>During every shift change, the safe funds should be verified by the oncoming and departing manager. The restaurant leader and Above Store Leader must be notified immediately for large variances.</li>
                <li>Cash amounts entered the back office system or cash-up app must be the actual cash counted, as opposed to the “should-be” amount.</li>
                <li>Keep your safe funds properly balanced at all times. This may mean shorting a deposit to make the safe balance or adding to a deposit to make the safe balance. The bottom line is that safe overages and shortages need to be reconciled by the end of the day.</li>
                <li>Cashiers should always count their cash drawer before accepting it.</li>
                <li>To keep drawers in check, schedule cashiers for shorter shifts or settle their drawer every five hours.</li>
                <li>Do not allow multiple hands in cash drawers, only the assigned cashier should be working the register assigned to them.</li>
                <li>Cashiers should count (or witness the counting) of their cash drawer at the end of their shift and sign the corresponding paperwork. Scheduling is essential to getting this right since you need to allow managers and cashiers enough time to count their drawers at the beginning and end of their scheduled shifts.</li>
                <li>Put systems in place to verify banknotes. The manager in charge should verify and handle the change for the guest. Counterfeit marking pens should be used for any large or questionable bills. Smart safe bill readers can also be used to detect counterfeit bills, especially for stores with smart safes.</li>
                <li>Limit the amount of money in the cash drawer. You can do this by using “cash drop boxes” underneath and near each cash register for storing all banknotes. But the important thing is that the manager in charge must monitor the cash in the drawer.</li>
                <li>Register keys should always be on the manager’s duty. Keys in the cash drawer is a huge red flag that there’s something wrong with your cash handling procedures.</li>
                <li>Count all cash on camera (if possible) and keep it secured, in a safe, locked cash drawer, or locked office.</li>
                <li>Reconcile reported daily deposits with validated deposit slips or Smart Safe Reports, and make sure they match. If they don’t, then contact a supervisor immediately.</li>
                <li>You should never have cash at the premised more than your insurance policy covers, and you should never take more cash than your insurance policy covers i.e., “cash in transit”. Check with your senior reporting manager about the limits.</li>
                <li>Always pull out the entire cash drawer and check no banknotes or credit card receipts have found their way to the back of the till.</li>
                <li>Cash-out each till individually. Ensure the cash of the day is total cash after deducting the fixed float at each till. Never leave the float short. Any daily cash variances Under or Over shall be entered on the cash-up app with a written explanation.</li>
